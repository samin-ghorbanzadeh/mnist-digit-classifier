# mnist-digit-classifier
MNIST Digit Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with scikit-learn
Sure! Here’s a clean, ready-to-use **README.md** content for your Phase 1 folder:
This project demonstrates a comprehensive exploration of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors classification model using the scikit-learn library.

## Key Features

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset  
- Visualizing sample digit images and class distribution  
- Computing and displaying average digit images per class  
- Training a KNN classifier and evaluating its performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices  
- Interactive input for flexible model configuration (number of samples to display, K value)  

## Files

- `mnist_knn_sklearn.py`: Main script including visualization, training, and evaluation  
- `evaluate_k_variation.py`: Script to test model accuracy over different values of k  

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:  
   `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas seaborn tensorflow`  

2. Run `mnist_knn_sklearn.py` to explore data and train the model.  

3. Run `evaluate_k_variation.py` to evaluate model accuracy with varying k values.
